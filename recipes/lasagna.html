    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This classic lasagna recipe is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. </p>
    <p>Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is great for feeding a big family and freezes well, too.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li> 1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li> 2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
        <li>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li> 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (preferably flat leaf), packed</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li> 1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt</li>

        <li> 1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup sugar (to taste, optional)</li>
        <li> Salt</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the diced bell pepper and onions to the skillet (in the photo we are using yellow bell pepper and red onions). </li>
        <li>Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent and the peppers softened. Add the minced garlic and cook half a minute more. </li>
        <li>Return the browned ground beef to the pan. Stir to combine, reduce the heat to low, and cook for another 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>Transfer the beef mixture to a medium-sized (3- to 4-quart) pot. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste to the pot. </li>
        <li>Sprinkle with red or white wine vinegar. Stir in sugar, a tablespoon at a time, tasting after each addition, to taste. (The amount of sugar needed will vary, depending on how acidic the tomatoes are that you are using.) </li>
        <li>Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer. Cook for 15 to 45 minutes</li>
